# Hamilton Murph White

This clock or watch design is based on the Hamilton Khaki Field Murph Automatic.
If I am breaking any copyright rules by copying the design of this watch
then I am happy to remove this project, but I am a big fan Hamilton watches
and the designs they use. I spent a long time looking at lots of different watches
before deciding that this was one of my favourite.

This project uses hand crafted **SVG** files created using Affinity Designer 2,
and is made into a working time piece with **Javascript**, **CSS**, and **HTML**.

By using the **Zoom In** and **Zoom Out** feature of your browser you can change
the size of the watch face.
