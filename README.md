# Hamilton Murph White

This clock or watch design is based on the **Hamilton Khaki Field Murph Automatic**.

If I am breaking any copyright rules by copying the design of this watch
then I am happy to remove this project, but I am a big fan Hamilton watches
and the designs they use.

This project uses hand crafted **SVG** files exported from the Affinity Designer file.
The SVG files are made into a working time piece with **Javascript**, **CSS**, and **HTML**.

By using the **Zoom In** and **Zoom Out** feature of your browser you can change
the size of the watch face. I have only tested it with the Safari browser on my Mac and iPhone.

The end result can be viewed here: https://c-sk8.github.io/hamilton-murph-white/
